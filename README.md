My First GitHub Repository
I am a General Science student at Seattle University and am very happy to announce that I just received my acceptance letter for next fall into the Graduate Certificate in Computer Science program. My goal is to advance after the first year certificate is completed and earn my Master's Degree in Computer Science (MSCS).
